  <h3><em>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</em></h3>
  <p>I think that web accessibility means that everyone including people with disabilities should be able to use and navigate anything on the internet. There are many reasons why the web should be accessible to everyone since it would make it easier for businesses to connect with a larger customer base which helps them get more loyal customers. Since the internet plays a big role in everyone's day-to-day life it would make it a lot easier for people to connect with eachother.</p>

  <h3><em>Final Project Revision and Reflection</em></h3>
  <p>Looking back at making my final project, I feel good about how it turned out, but I also see areas that could be improved. My main goal was to build a simple, clean website using only the HTML and CSS you taught us. While I am happy with the overall design, I realize I had too big of an idea for the website design so it took me longer to get started on the project than if I tried to do a smaller design and build on that I probably would have had a better design. If I were to redo the project, I would use some JavaScript so I could do more things design-wise a lot easier.
  </p><p>One of the biggest challenges I faced was trying to remember was trying to fix the errors that showed up every time I tried to change the background. Even after somehow fixing the problem I am still having trouble fully understanding it. I also had trouble remembering the right code to use for some things I wanted to do and, I couldn't find out how to fix it by looking it up online so I had to sacrifice some things and do a workaround.
  </p><p>So I showed my mom, sister, and nana my website and they wouldn’t give me a detailed answer about what they thought about my website they all said that they were not surprised about the topic I chose and that they liked the design of my website and that is about it. I was not happy they wouldn’t give me a detailed answer I asked my engineering teacher and all he said was that he liked the design and that was it. I wish I had more to say but they were the only people I could ask. I’m really happy with what I was able to do for my first time making a website by myself and I honestly had fun making it.</p>

  <h3><em>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment </em></h3>
  <p>Progressive Enhancement focuses on the content first and is kind of like layering it starts with the content then the presentation and lastly the scripts. This topic is important because it helps your website be inclusive and adaptable, and provides a high-quality experience for everyone. To better understand the topic I read an article from <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/">Smashing Magazine By Sam Dwyer. </a></p>

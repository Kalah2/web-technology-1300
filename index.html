  <h3><em>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</em></h3>
  <p>I think that web accessibility means that everyone including people with disabilities should be able to use and navigate anything on the internet. There are many reasons why the web should be accessible to everyone since it would make it easier for businesses to connect with a larger customer base which helps them get more loyal customers. Since the internet plays a big role in everyone's day-to-day life it would make it a lot easier for people to connect with eachother.</p>

            <p1>BTS, also known as Bangtan Sonyeondan (Bulletproof Boy Scouts), is a South Korean boy band that has reshaped the global music industry. Formed in 2013 by Big Hit Entertainment, the group originally consisted of seven members: RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. They debuted with the single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, introducing a raw, hip-hop-inspired sound that focused on themes like societal pressure, dreams, and personal struggles. Although they started with modest success, their authenticity and relatable messages quickly earned them a dedicated fanbase.</p1>
                <p1> By 2015, BTS's breakthrough album The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 1 began gaining them recognition outside South Korea. Their music evolved to address more complex themes, including youth, love, and mental health, while their performances showcased incredible talent and energy. The group’s popularity skyrocketed with the release of Wings in 2016, and in 2017, BTS solidified their global presence with the Love Yourself series, which not only dominated the charts but also connected deeply with fans on themes of self-love and empowerment.</p1>
                <p1>BTS's success continued to grow exponentially with the release of Map of the Soul: Persona in 2019, and their first No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2020 with the song “Dynamite.” As the first K-pop group to top the Billboard charts, BTS shattered records and made history. Their music, which blends genres like pop, hip-hop, and R&B, has resonated with millions around the world, earning them a loyal global fanbase known as ARMY.</p1>
               <p1>Beyond music, BTS has used their platform for activism, promoting messages of mental health awareness, social justice, and self-empowerment. Their impact goes far beyond entertainment, as they continue to inspire fans with their authenticity, resilience, and advocacy for positive change.</p1>
               <p1>As of 2023, the group announced a temporary hiatus to focus on individual projects and fulfill mandatory military service, but their legacy as one of the most influential groups in music history remains intact. With millions of records sold, groundbreaking performances, and a lasting cultural impact, BTS has redefined what it means to be a global artist, proving that music, passion, and a strong sense of purpose can transcend borders and unite people worldwide.</p1>
